The code for my homepage. (Written in Haskell.)
While not intended as a general framework, it is (in theory) modular enough
that changes to content or style shouldn't be too much effort; feel free to
modify it to taste.
The templates are there more for example than anything else, as any changes in
content will probably end up wiping them away.
